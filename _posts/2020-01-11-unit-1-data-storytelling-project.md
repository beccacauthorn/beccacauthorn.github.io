I have been passionate about soccer (or football if you aren't from the U.S.) since I started playing the game at age 5. I loved the smell of the grass on a crisp game-day morning, the rush of adrenaline as I sped towards the ball, getting to know my teammates, and the excitment of learning new skills and strategies at each game and practice session. 

As I have grown older and begun to follow professional leagues and competitions, I have become increasingly interested in how data and technology is being used to inform the game as well as allow players to stay at their peak for longer. In order to further explore this topic I decided to use my first data storytelling project to look at what if any relationship there might be between average player age per team and a team's number of wins or points. I found a [dataset](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/3dataset) that had international competition as well as club competition data for 2017 and 2018.  

At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.
